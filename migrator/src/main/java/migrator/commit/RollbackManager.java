/**
 * Manages rollback by restoring from checkpoint via {@link CracController}.

 * <p>The rollback manager is invoked when migration fails (e.g., smoke test failure,
 * timeout, or exception during migration). It attempts to restore the application
 * to its pre-migration state using CRaC checkpoint restore.
 *
 * <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The {@link #rollback()} method may not return
 * if the checkpoint restore replaces the current process. When restore succeeds,
 * execution resumes from the checkpoint, and the caller's stack is discarded.
 *
 * <p>Annotate your implementation with {@link migrator.annotations.RollbackComponent}
 * for automatic discovery during classpath scanning.
