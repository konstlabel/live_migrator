/**
 * Core interface for implementing class migration logic.
 *
 * <p>Implement this interface to define how instances of an old class type
 * should be transformed into instances of a new class type during live migration.
 * The migration engine will discover implementations via the {@link migrator.annotations.Migrator}
 * annotation and invoke them for each object found during heap walking.
 *
 * <h2>Example:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Migrator
 * public class UserV1ToV2Migrator implements ClassMigrator&lt;UserV1, UserV2&gt; {
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public UserV2 migrate(UserV1 old) {
 *         return new UserV2(old.getName(), old.getEmail(), LocalDateTime.now());
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void validate(UserV2 migrated) throws MigrateException {
 *         if (migrated.getEmail() == null) {
 *             throw new MigrateException("Email cannot be null");
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety:</h2>
 * <p>Implementations should be stateless or thread-safe, as the migration engine
 * may invoke {@link #migrate(Object)} from multiple threads concurrently.
 *
 * @param <OldT> the source class type being migrated from
 * @param <NewT> the target class type being migrated to
 * @see migrator.annotations.Migrator
 * @see migrator.engine.MigrationEngine
