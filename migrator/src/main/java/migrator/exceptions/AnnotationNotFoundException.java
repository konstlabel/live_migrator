/**
 * Exception thrown when a required migration annotation is not found during classpath scanning.
 *
 * <p>The migration framework requires certain annotated classes to be present:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link migrator.annotations.Migrator} - exactly one required</li>
 *   <li>{@link migrator.annotations.PhaseListener} - exactly one required</li>
 *   <li>{@link migrator.annotations.CommitComponent} - exactly one required</li>
 *   <li>{@link migrator.annotations.RollbackComponent} - exactly one required</li>
 *   <li>{@link migrator.annotations.SmokeTestComponent} - at least one required</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This exception is thrown when the {@link migrator.scanner.AnnotationScanner} cannot
 * locate a required annotated class, or when multiple classes are found for a
 * single-instance annotation.
 *
 * <p>This is an unchecked exception because missing annotations indicate a
 * configuration/deployment problem that cannot be recovered at runtime.
