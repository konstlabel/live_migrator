/**
 * Interface for patching object references during migration.

 * <p>Implementations traverse object graphs and replace references to old
 * objects with references to their migrated counterparts using a
 * {@link ForwardingTable}. This is the core mechanism that ensures all
 * references in the application point to the new migrated objects.
 *
 * <p>Reference patching handles:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Instance fields (including private and inherited fields)</li>
 *   <li>Static fields (for registries and caches)</li>
 *   <li>Array elements</li>
 *   <li>Collection elements (List, Set, Map)</li>
 *   <li>Immutable containers (Optional, WeakReference, etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
